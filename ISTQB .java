Hands On - Write 2-3 defects which have faced in real time working on a product/software application.

Test Objectives:-
----------------

1). Evaluating the product/application against requirements(PRD/FRS), DESIGN AND code.
2). Triggering fsilures ---> Log Defects(JIRA)
3). Ensuring Test coverage
	Feature Login --> 12 test cases.
	Test Execution ---> 10 test cases (test coverage=12-10) 80%
4). Reducing the level of risks of inadequate poor quality of product.
5). Verifying the specified requirement are working as expected.
6). Verify that the product compiles with the constructual, legal and regulatory requirement.
7). Proding information to stakeholders about the status of application and make informed decisions.
8). Building confidence in the quality of the product.



Testing and Debugging:-
---------------------

Testing: Sugnya test App. ... Executing the test cases, issues/defects.

Login the defect in JIRA. Item is not getting added to cart.
		          _________________________________

Assign it to Developer ------ Debugging.


Debugging : Debugging is the process of finding the cause of Failure (Defects), analysing these causes
and eliminating them.

Debugging process involves following steps:
------------------------------------------
1). Reproduction of failure.
2). Diagnosis (Findig the root cause).
3). Fixing the cause/defect.


Why testing is necessary:-
------------------------

1). Testing contributes to Success.
2). Testing(Validation) and Quality Assurance(Verification)
       - Verification    - How to build the product right? --> Process/Activities. --> Testing on test artefacts.
     --> Review the test artefacts like test cases, test plans, test strategy doc.
       - and Validation. - Am i building the right prouct. --> Testing the real product quality control.


QA(Quality Assurance) :-
----------------------

--> Quality assurance is a process oriented and preventive approach that focuses on 
    implementation and improvement. If you follow the good process, then it will generate a high
    quality product. QA is applicable for both Dev and Testers.

Quality Control QC:-
------------------

--> Quality control is a product oriented and corrective approach. Testing is major from of QC.

3). Errors, Defects, Failures and Root Causes.

Errors --> Human beings makes error (Coding error)----> It will produce defects(bugs) --> Which may
result in Failures.


Humans beings make error:-
------------------------

1). He is under pressure.
2). Complexity of products.
3). Lack of adequate training.

Defects:-
--------

1). Documentation defects (Requirement defects, test case/Script, Review defects).
2). Functionality defect.
3). Performance defect.
4). Usability defect.
5). Accessibility defect.
6). Security Defect.

Reasions for failure other then Defect/Error :-
----------------------------------------------

1). Earthquake happened ---> Servers crashed / net is down.
2). Electromagnetic radition.
3). Water purification are not working well after 3-4 months. Environmetal reasions.

Root Cause:-
-----------

--> Fundamental reasion for the occurence of the problem.


Testing Principles:-
-------------------

1). Testing shows the presence, but not the absence of defects.
2). Exhaustive testing is impossible:-
    --------------------------------

	Printing which can print 1-500 pages.
	Input Username box --> 5 - 20 characters, alphanumeric, _@$
	Reasions --> Budgest, time constaints.

3). Early testing saves time and money:-
    ----------------------------------

	Suganya found some defect in Sprint1.

	For example sprint 3, functionality is released to production.
	
	Defect is coming to production.

4). Defect Clustering :
    -------------------
 
    Cluster means group. More no of defects found in a particular
    area/feature of an application. If teste have this knowledge, he can do through testing and 
    put more efforts in that error prone area.

5). Pesticide paradox / Tests Wear OUT:
--------------------------------------

--> Executing same test cases over a period of time may not be effective as the application
    have gone through changes over a period of time.

6). Testing is context dependent.
7). Absence of Defects Fallacy :(Misconception)



Test Activities and Tasks:-
--------------------------

1). Test Planning:
-----------------

--> Defining the test objectives and selecting an approach (test strategey) that best achieves
    the objectives. (Chapter 5).

2). Test Monitoring and control : 
---------------------------------

100 test cases --- 6 people
Suganya is absent

3). Test Analysis :
-------------------

--> Idenify the test basis to identify what needs to be tested, what needs to be prioritised.

--> What to test.

--> Login features :-  Valid username and valid password
	               Invalid username and valid password.

4). Test Design.
---------------

How to test ... Test cases.
Valid username and valid password.

5). Test Implementation :-
-------------------------

Organise test cases functionally, test data and test environment.

6). Test Execution :-
--------------------

--> Execution of test cases.

7). Test Completion :-
---------------------

Testing Process in context:-
--------------------------

Testing is dependent on different factors --

1). Stake holders  ( Willingness to cooperate).
2). Team members ( Skills, knoweldge and level of experience)
3). Business Domain (Critical of domain).
4). Technical factors(AI based application).
5). Project Constraints(Scope, time, bdge, resources).
6). Organizational factors.
7). SDLC
8). Tools (REST API--> POSTMAN, AUTOMATION - WEBDRIVER).


TESTWARE:-
---------

Any artefact produced or used the testing process.

1). Test Paln.
2). Test Cases.
3). Test Scripts (Automation Selenium Scripts).
4). Test Data.
5). Twst Environment.
6). Test logs and reports.
7). Test tool. --> POSTMAN,SELENIUM WB, JMETER.
