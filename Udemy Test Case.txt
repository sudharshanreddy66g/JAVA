Writing Good Test Cases:-
-------------------------
-> As fas as possible, write test cases in such a way that you test only one thing at a time.
   Do not overlap or complicate test cases. Attempt to make your test case 'automic'.
-> Ensure that all positive scenarios and negative scenarios are covered.
-> Language:
	-> Write in simple and easy-to-understand language.
	-> Use active voice instead of passive voice: Do this, do that.
	-> Use exact and consistent names (of forms, fileds, etc).
-> Characteristics of a good test case:
  -------------------------------------
	-> Accurate: Exacts the purpose.
	-> Economical: No unnecessary steps or words.
	-> Traceable: Capable of being traced to requirements.
	-> Repeatable: Can be used to perform the test over and over.
	-> Reusable: Can be reused if necessary.
