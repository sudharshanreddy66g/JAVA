What is a Black Box Testing ?
-----------------------------

Black box testing, which is also known as behavioral, opaue-box, closed-box, specifiaction-based or
eye-to-eye testing, is a software testing method that analyses the functionality of a 
software/application without knowing much about the internal structure/design of the item that is
being tested and compares the input values with the output value.


The main foucs in black box testing is on the fuctionality of the system as a whole. The term
"behavioral testing" is also used for black box testing. Behavioral test design is slighlty different from
the black box test design beacse the use of internal knowledge isn't strictly forbidden, but it's still discouraged.

Each testing method has its own advatages and disadvantages. There are some bugs that cannot be found using the only black box or only white box technique.
Majority of the applications are tested by black box method. We need to cover the majority of the test cases so that most of the bugs will get discovered by a black-box method.

The testing occurs throught the software development and testing life cycle i.e in Unit, Integration, System, Acceptance, and regression testing stages.

This cann be both functaional or non-functiona.

Types of Black Box Testing:-

What is a White Box Testing ?

If we go by the definition, "White box testing" (also known as clear, glass box or structural testing) is a 
testing techniue which evaluates the code and the internal structure of a program.

White box testing invloves looking at the structure of the code. When you know the internal structure of a product, tests
can be conducted to ensure that the internal operations perfored according to the 
specification. And all internal components have been adequately exercised.




What is Cross Browser Testing ?


Cross Browser Testing is a process to test web application across multiple browsers.
Cross Browser testing invloves checking compatibility of your application across multiple web browsers and ensures
that your web application works correctly across diffrent web browsers.


What is User Acceptance Testing (UAT) ?

User Acceptance Testing is the process of verifying that a created solution/software works for 'the user'.
This might sound easy enough but, in practice, it isn't .
User Acceptance Tests consist of a set of test steps, which verify if specific requirements are working for the user.
