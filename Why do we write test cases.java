Why do we write test cases ?

1). There will be good, Test coverage.
2). There will be better, Consistency.
3). Depends on the process rather than the person.
4). To Avoid the training for every new person.
5). It acts like as a Proof of the document.
6). It act like as a Base document.
7). No need to remember for scenarios.
8). Execution hapens in Organized manner.
9). Less time for execution.


Test case design Techniques
---------------------------

It is a technique which is used while writing test case in order to improve test coverage.

Types of Test case design techniques:-
-------------------------------------
1). Error Guessing.
2). Equivalence class partitioning (ECP).
3). Boundary Value Analysis(BVA). 


1). Error Guessing:-
-------------------

Here we guess all possible errors and we derive the scanarios.
We guess erros based on:
i).  Requirement.
ii). Experience
iii).Depends on the Test engineer memory power management.


2). Equivalence Class Partition :-
---------------------------------

i). Pressman rule.

-> Rule 1:-
a. Pressman Rule:-
----------------

Rule 1:-
------

If the input is a range of values, then design test case for one valid and two invalid inputs.

Rule 2:-
------

If the input is in a set of values, then design test case for one valid and two invalid inputs.


Rule 3:-
------

If the input is boolean, then desing the test case for both true and false values.


ii). Practice method.

a.Practice Method:-
------------------

If the input is the range of values then divide the range into equivalent parts 







Note:-
----




3). Boundary Value Analysis (BVA):-
----------------------------------

If the input is range of values b/w A to B then design test case for A, A+1, A-1 and B, B+1, B-1.



Best combination:-
------------------

BVA+Error Gussing=Range of Valus 
Pressmen Rule + Error Gussing = SET of Values.
Practice Method + Error Guess = Range Of Values With Deviation.
